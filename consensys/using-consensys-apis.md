## Ujo

Ujo is a music platform that uses the ethereum blockchain as the substrate for innovation by empowering artists, digitizing their music rights and metadata, sharing this information in an open environment, thus enabling new applications, products, and services to license their catalogs and pay artists directly with minimal friction.

## Truffle

Truffle is a world class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum, aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier. If you decide to build a dApp this weekend, Truffle is the industry standard for doing so, well. http://truffleframework.com/ [Truffle Tutorials](http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/): A great introduction to building dApps  


## Infura

Infura provides secure, reliable, and scalable access to Ethereum and IPFS. They provide the infrastructure for your decentralized applications so you can focus on the features.

## MetaMask

MetaMask is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser today. It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node. MetaMask includes a secure identity vault, providing a user interface to manage your identities on different sites and sign blockchain transactions.

[https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io/) How to use MetaMask: [https://blog.ujomusic.com/how-to-use-metamask-for-chrome-f258e6034226](https://blog.ujomusic.com/how-to-use-metamask-for-chrome-f258e6034226) Examples of how to integrate MetaMask: [https://github.com/danfinlay/MetaMaskStack](https://github.com/danfinlay/MetaMaskStack)

## uPort

uPort is an interoperable identity network for a secure, private, decentralized web. uPort provides open protocols for decentralized identity and interoperable messaging that enable trusted source attribution for all web communication. By allowing message recipients to trust message senders without centralized servers, we can create an entirely new framework for building applications.[https://www.uport.me](https://www.uport.me/) [https://developer.uport.me](https://developer.uport.me/)
