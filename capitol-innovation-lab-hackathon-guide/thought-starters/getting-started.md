The 7Digital APIs provide many methods for browsing and streaming a catalog of tracks made available by Capitol Music Group \(CMG\). Capitol Music Group \(CMG\) is comprised of Capitol Records, Virgin Records, Motown Records, Blue Note Records, Astralwerks, Harvest Records, Capitol Christian Music Group, and CMG’s independent distribution division, Caroline.

## **Docs**

7digital provide a full set of API endpoints for building end-to-end subscription streaming services. For the hackathon we have only enabled the Music Discovery API’s \(Catalogue APIs\) and the track streaming endpoints for full length and clip length audio.
