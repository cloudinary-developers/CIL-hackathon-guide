## Build a Music Discovery Service

Create a community-based music sharing and discovery site. Make the focus on user-generated content, let your users [upload](../media-management-apis/uploading-media/social-and-cloud-sources.md), tag and categorize their music.

Engage users with [beautiful visualizations](../media-management-apis/visualization/audio-to-waveform-images.md) of the music audio and video tracks. Showcase each video using our [HTML5 Video Player](../media-management-apis/audio-and-video/html5-video-player.md). Display beautiful layouts of artist photos, album art and fan photos in [rich and responsive layouts](../media-management-apis/web-performance/image-optimization-i.md) that are [sized perfectly ](../media-management-apis/web-performance/image-optimization-ii.md)for users’ devices.

Use our powerful APIs to search the fan photos and videos that have been[ auto-tagged and automatically identified](../media-management-apis/ai-tagging-and-recognition/categorizing-images.md) upon upload. Add [content moderation](../media-management-apis/ai-tagging-and-recognition/content-moderation.md) to ensure that your user uploads meets your community standards.

### Choose a Serverless Stack

Resist the urge to create an Express app and deploy a server for this one! Instead, focus on using each API directly within a Single Page App \(SPA\) to take advantage of the responsive design possibilities.

Cloudinary's APIs work elegantly with Auth0 [Webtasks](https://webtask.io) and other serverless platforms. We support many languages, including JavaScript and [Node.js](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration).

### Use This Guide to Get Started

We've organized the Cloudinary resources in this guide by functionality so you can quickly add a feature to your application. Each article is a short and concise walkthrough, so you won't have to comb too deep through our extensive [documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation), unless you want to.

### Tweet/Share your Experience

We know your Hackathon experience will be fun and engaging. Don't forget to share that with your friends on social media. _**In fact, we've added links at the top of this guide to make sharing easy.**_. Learning about visualizing an audio waveform? Show the world what you are working on and let them learn about these cool technologies, right along with you.
